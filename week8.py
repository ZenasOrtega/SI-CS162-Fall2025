#make a recursive fxn that is able to add incrementing numbers X times, where X is the user input, retunr the sum
  #ex say IP = 3, then it be 1+2+3 = 6, return 6

#make a recursive fxn that can identify if a string is a palindrome (attempt first w/out notes :)
  #ex "racecar" is backwards for "racecar" 

#make a recursive fxn for the fibonacci sequence (same here, attempt first w/out notes
  #ex 0+1+1+2+3+5+8 (the next number is the sum of the previous two)

#make a recursive fxn that is able to print out the factors of a user inputted number
  #ex IP = 20, then it prints: 1, 2 , 4 , 5, 10, 20
